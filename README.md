Greetings! My name is Tito Adiyanto, and welcome to my GitHub. I am happy to share my portfolio on this GitHub. This portfolio is one of the tasks assigned to me as a project in the Data Science education course program at Purwadhika.
In short, this project emphasizes creating book data in the library, using Python programming as the basis for building a data management system. In its application, the system will use CRUD functions, also known as (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), as its operating basis.
I hope this portfolio can provide you with useful information. Thank you for your visit.

Book Data Management System
Using a book data management system in the library can improve efficiency and minimize book loss. Librarians are required to be able to quickly find out information about the status of books, and this system will be very helpful.
A book data management system can help librarians to:
•	Track the existence of books
•	Manage the borrowing and return of books
•	Record damage and loss of books
•	Improve the accuracy of book data
•	Prevent book duplication
By using a book data management system, libraries can ensure that their books are well-managed and can be easily accessed by visitors.

So, without further ado, let’s get in to it:
What’s this apps do?
The apps will be able to do these things:
1.	View The Available Book List
2.	Create/Adding a New Book to the list
3.	Read/View Book List
4.	Book List Update
5.	Delete books
6.	Calculate the fee

In this view, you will see several list of options that you can choose from. The example options are as follows:
•	Menampilkan Daftar Buku (View Book List): This option will display a list of all the books that are available to borrow.
•	Meminjam Buku (Borrow Book): This option will allow you to borrow a book from the library.
•	Exit (Exit App): This option will close the app.
•	Etc,.

Here is the book catalog. It is where you can browse and select which book you would like to borrow.
The catalog includes the book's title, availability, rental fee, author, and publication year.
To select a book, you will need to choose the index number next to the book.
ADD BOOK INTO THE LIST
Adding a book to the list can be done in a straightforward manner. By selecting index number 2, you will be prompted to provide several pieces of information about the book, such as its title, author, published year, and rent price.
It is important that you read the instructions carefully and provide accurate information. If you make a mistake, the book may not be added to the list correctly.

The delete function prompts the user to select the book they would like to delete. Once the user has selected the book, it is automatically deleted and the list is updated.




BORROW BOOK FROM THE LIST

The borrowing process is a bit more complex than the other processes, as it involves some calculations for the rental books. However, this will be done automatically, so you can simply sit back and relax.
When you choose to borrow a book, you will be prompted to answer a few questions, such as the number of books you want to borrow. The system will then automatically calculate the total cost of borrowing the books and display it to you. 
It is important to read the questions carefully and answer them accurately to ensure that the process runs smoothly. If you make a mistake, you may not be able to borrow the books or you may be charged incorrectly.
Once you have answered the questions and agreed to the cost, the system will automatically borrow the books for you. 
The borrowing process is designed to be as simple and convenient as possible for customers. However, it is important to be aware of the steps involved and to read the instructions carefully to ensure that the process runs smoothly.
 






UPDATE BOOK FROM THE LIST:

When you choose index 5, you will be prompted to provide the following information:
•	Book title: The title of the book that you want to update.
•	Number of books: The number of books that you want to update.
•	Author: The author of the book that you want to update.
•	Published year: The year in which the book was published.
•	Book rent price: The price of renting the book.
It is important that you read the instructions carefully and fill out the form correctly. If you make a mistake, you may not be able to update the book information.
Well, that’s all folks! You may want to try it and perhaps modify it by yourself, I will be thrilled and please be my guest to modify it as per your liking.

And a bit disclaimer:
All the codes are made solely just for learning purpose, and those will not be used for other purpose aside from above that have been said. And the author will not be responsible should the codes are used from any purposes that have been said above earlier.
